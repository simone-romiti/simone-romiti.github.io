# PhD in Theoretical Physics (3 years)

2018 - 2021: [**Roma Tre University**, Rome, Italy](https://www.uniroma3.it/int/)

- [Department of Mathematics and Physics](https://matematicafisica.uniroma3.it/)  
- **Thesis:** *The neutron proton mass difference in Lattice QCD+QED*
- **Supervisors:** Vittorio Lubicz, Silvano Simula  
- **Submission date:** 31 October 2021
- **Dissertation defense:**[^1] 22 April 2022  

[^1]: As in many other countries, in Italy the PhD thesis dissertation takes place months after the submission, in order for the referees to evaluate your work. Upon positive evaluation, the exact date is decided by the Department's committee. The day after the submission, I started a postdoc position in Germany (check out my [experience section](experience.qmd)).
