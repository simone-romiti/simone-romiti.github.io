Some libraries are still involved in the development of scientific (or personal) projects, and will become open-source as soon as the corresponding paper is published.
Here I list them, providing the links that will be active when 

- HLbL contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$: [pole contribution at large distances](https://github.com/simone-romiti/gm2_HLbL_work)
- **Hamiltonian simulations of SU(2) lattice gauge theories**: [solvers](https://github.com/HISKP-LQCD/HLGTSolvers) and [toolkit](https://github.com/HISKP-LQCD/HLGTTools)
- **Installation of ETM collaboration's lattice QCD software stack**: [installation instructions and scripts for different machines](https://github.com/simone-romiti/software-stack)
- **Nutritionist software toolkit**: [a `streamlit` app to handle patients, their progresses and diet, nutrients conversions and equivalences](https://github.com/simone-romiti/nutri-1)
