I am the creator and maintainer of the library [`lattice_data_tools`](https://github.com/simone-romiti/lattice_data_tools), a software toolkit for the statistical analysis of lattice data.
Some features are, for instance:

-  Extraction of effective masses and amplitudes from lattice correlators
- Standard routines in the calculation of the hadronic contributions to $(g-2)_\mu$
- Analysis  of Monte Carlo trajectories
- Bootstrap and jackknife sampling
- Least-squares fit of functions $\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{m}$
- Bayesian Model Averaging, Akaike's Information Criterion

`lattice_data_tools` is also part of the [Lattice QFT software list](https://lattice-software.github.io/list/).
