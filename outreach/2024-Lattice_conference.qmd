# Information 


**From the 28th July 2024 to the 3rd of August 2024** I attended the [Lattice 2024 international conference](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/1265/) in Liverpool, UK.

In [my talk](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/1265/contributions/7618/) I described the application of Nested Sampling to SU(N) lattice gauge theories, with focus on U(1) in 2+1 dimensions.
My talk was the first of three talks on Nested Sampling that I co-authored with [Urs Wenger](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/1265/contributions/7617/) and [Gurtej Kanwar](https://conference.ippp.dur.ac.uk/event/1265/contributions/7619/).
