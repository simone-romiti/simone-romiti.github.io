# Information about my talk

In the week 3-7 March 2025 I attended a workshop at [ECT* (Trento)] about [_Scale setting: Precision lattice QCD for particle and nuclear physics_](https://indico.ectstar.eu/event/229/overview), as an **invited speaker**.

In [my talk](https://indico.ectstar.eu/event/229/contributions/5308/), I reported on how in the ETM collaboration we had achieved a sub-permille level of precision on the lattice spacing in isoQCD, using the [Ebinburgh/FLAG consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04268).
