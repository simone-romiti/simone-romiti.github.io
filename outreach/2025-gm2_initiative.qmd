# Information about my talk

I gave a [talk at the IJC lab in Orsay](https://indico.ijclab.in2p3.fr/event/11652/contributions/39079/attachments/26172/38803/Romiti-Orsay.pdf) for the [2025 $(g-2)_\mu$ initiative workshop](https://indico.ijclab.in2p3.fr/event/11652/).
I presented the the progress of the ETM collaboration on the HLbL contribution to $(g-2)_\mu$, with focus on the flavor contribution coming from the light flavors ($u,d$) and the heavy quarks $s,c$.
