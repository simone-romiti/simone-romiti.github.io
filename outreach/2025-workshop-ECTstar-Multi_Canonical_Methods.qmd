# Information about my talk

I gave a [talk at ECT* in Trento](https://indico.ectstar.eu/event/248/contributions/6627/) about my recent arxiv submission [2510.26904](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26904).
I discussed how one can perform an _adiabatic learning_ of a Physics-Informed Neural Network in order to find the renormalization flow of the eigenfunctions and energies of a SU(N) lattice gauge theory.
