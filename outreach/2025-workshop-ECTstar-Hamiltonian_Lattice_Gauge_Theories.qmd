# Information about the event

In the week 1-5 Sept. 2025 I was one of the leading organizers of the [workshop on _Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: Status, Novel Developments and Applications_](https://indico.ectstar.eu/event/242/).
On the last day me and C. Urbach gave a [talk](https://indico.ectstar.eu/event/242/contributions/5858/), summarizing the content of the workshop and the final considerations based on the talks and discussion sessions had during the week.
