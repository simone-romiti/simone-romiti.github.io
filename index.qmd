# Welcome to my website

I am a theoretical computational physicist in the field of High Energy Physics.
In my work I use computers to provide high-precision quantitative predictions of physical quantities, in those regimes where analytic solutions are out of reach.

- **Current employer**: [University of Bern](https://www.itp.unibe.ch/about_us/people/people/index_eng.html?id=265)
- **Job title**: Postdoctoral Researcher
- **Education**: PhD in Theoretical Physics


My main areas of interest are: 

- Quantum Field Theories on the **lattice**, **QCD** phenomenology
- **Machine Learning** for scientific applications, Physics-Informed Neural Networks
- **Markov chain Monte Carlo**, Bayesian algorithms

[Education](./education.qmd) | [Experience](./experience.qmd) | [Teaching](teaching.qmd)

You can learn much more about me on this website. Check out the top bar for some macro-sections, and my posts below.

<!-- I have expertise in developing and optimizing numerical algorithms for large-scale simulations, with strong programming skills in `C/C++`, `Python`, Machine Learning for scientific applications, and daily work on GNU/Linux systems. 

I have a proven track record in collaborative research, publications in well recognizerd scientific journals, and I contribute to major international physics collaborations. 

Over the years, I also gained significant experience in mentoring students and teaching. -->
