:::{#general-info}

I am a theoretical physicist in High Energy Physics, with experience in Quantum Field Theories on the lattice, QCD phenomenology, and computational methods. 

I have expertise in developing and optimizing numerical algorithms for large-scale simulations, with strong programming skills in `C/C++`, `Python`, Machine Learning for scientific applications, and daily work on GNU/Linux systems. 

I have a proven track record in collaborative research, publications in well recognizerd scientific journals, and I contribute to major international physics collaborations. 

Over the years, I also gained significant experience in mentoring students and teaching.
