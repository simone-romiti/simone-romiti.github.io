This is relevant for match the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms at finite lattice spacing, where they differ for discretization effects."

The even had a broad scope for the general audience, covering several talks and activities about science in general.\nI contributed to the organization of the whole event and presented myself a demonstration of the Barkhausen effect, which provides a macroscopic evidence of the formation of Weiss domains in ferromagnetic materials.\nIn my presentation with title Electromagnetic… Attractions (Attrazioni… elettromagnetiche 🇮🇹), I used a transformer connected to a loudspeaker and a magnet. Passing the magnet next to the metal surrounding the transformer me and Alessio Rettaroli were able to reproduce in the loudspeaker the typical clicking noise of Weiss domains flip."

    "text": "Preamble\nIn Quantum Mechanics the fundamental equations are the Schrödinger equations. One depends on time, determining the evolution of a physical state: \\[i \\partial_t \\ket{\\psi} = H \\ket{\\psi}\\]\nThe other is the eigenvalue equation for the \\(n\\)-th eigenstate \\(\\psi_n\\): \\[H \\ket{\\psi}_n = E \\ket{\\psi}_n\\]\nIf the are able to solve the latter, the time evolution reads: \\[\n\\ket{\\psi(0)} = \\sum_n c_n \\ket{\\psi}_n\n\\, \\to \\,\n\\ket{\\psi(t)} = \\sum_n c_n e^{-i E_n t} \\ket{\\psi}_n\n\\]\nNote: Solving the Schrödinger equations can be simpler for some values of the parameters in the Hamiltonian (e.g. eq can use perturbation theory). For others, we have to resort to numerical methods.\n\n\nSummary of the paper\nIn this paper I proposed an algorithm to solve the eigenvalue equation with a neural network. The usefulness is the ability to solve the eigenvalue equation with a form of unsupervised learning, for values the coupling where the analytic solution is not known.\nThe key elements of originality are:\n\nThis has never been done for lattice gauge theories, and has the potential of overcoming the exponential curse of the Hilbert space size scaling.\nI define and successfully test a procedure to compute the coupling dependence of the solution (i.e. the renormalization flow of the eigenfunctions and energies)\nThe method is general and can be applied also to learn the dependence on other parameters of the Hamiltonian\nThis is an Hamiltonian method. As such, it does not suffer from the typical Monte Carlo hindrances: critical slowing down, topological freezing, sign problem, etc."
